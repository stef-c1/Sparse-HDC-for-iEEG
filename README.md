# Sparse-HDC-for-iEEG
This repository contains the code for my master thesis: Hardware Optimizations for iEEG Seizure Detection with Sparse Distributed Binary Hyperdimensional Computing

HDC_Processing.py: Main file to run to simulate the algorithmic performance of the accelerators.
HDC_functions.py: Functions for the HDC operations.
PostProcessing.py: To be run after HDC_Processing.py. This does the postprocessing as in the iEEG seizure detection with dense HDC paper.

The other directories contain the SystemVerilog code of the accelerators.
